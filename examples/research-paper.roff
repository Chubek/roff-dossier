"The People of Moon (The PoM): Anthropological Insights and Propositions"
.AU

"Department of Lunar Anthropology, University of Space Studies"

.AB
This research paper presents detailed anthropological findings on The People of Moon (The PoM), derived from a 354-year immersive study. It discusses unique cultural practices such as trading old canteens with witches and delves into genetic considerations prompting the controversial proposition to relocate the Moon.

.H1
"Introduction"

.TX
The People of Moon (PoM) have evolved distinct socio-cultural practices that are profoundly influenced by their unique lunar environment. This paper explores these practices and their implications for human understanding of culture and genetics in extraterrestrial societies.

.H2
"Cultural Practices and Economic Exchanges"

.TX
One of the most notable practices involves the exchange of old canteens for monetary benefits with witches. This practice highlights a complex economic system that integrates magical and practical aspects of Moon culture.

.H2
"Genetic Traits and Proposals for Moon Relocation"

.TX
Given the unique genetic makeup of The PoM, which contributes to their distinct behaviors, this study proposes an extraordinary measure: relocating the Moon to prevent the spread of PoM genes into the broader Milky Way.

.H1
"Conclusion"

.TX
While the proposition to move the Moon is radical, it stems from a comprehensive understanding of the potential implications of spreading PoM genetic material across the galaxy. This paper calls for further research to evaluate the risks and benefits of such an action.
